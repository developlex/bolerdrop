# STOREFRONT_FUNCTIONALITY_MATRIX.md

Status: DRAFT  
Type: Execution / Coverage Matrix  
Scope: Magento storefront baseline parity against decoupled storefront  
Freeze: Not applied

## 1. Purpose

This document tracks functional coverage between Magento's baseline storefront capabilities and the decoupled storefront implementation.

Goals:

- prevent hidden functionality gaps,
- make implementation status explicit,
- prioritize parity work with clear sequencing.

## 2. Status Definitions

- `Implemented`: End-user flow is available and runnable.
- `Partial`: Flow exists but is incomplete or missing critical sub-capabilities.
- `Missing`: No runnable flow is currently implemented.

## 3. Coverage Matrix

| Capability | Status | Coverage Notes | Primary Paths |
|---|---|---|---|
| Catalog browsing | Implemented | Catalog listing and product details are wired to Magento GraphQL. | `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/catalog.ts`, `frontend/storefront/app/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/product/[urlKey]/page.tsx` |
| Catalog search | Implemented | Query-based search via `?q=` is supported for catalog list and pagination routes. | `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/catalog.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/components/catalog-page-view.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/page/[page]/page.tsx` |
| Pagination | Implemented | Canonical pagination path `/page/<n>` with redirect from `?page=`. | `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/pagination.ts`, `frontend/storefront/app/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/page/[page]/page.tsx` |
| Product detail | Implemented | Product detail route + schema metadata + add-to-cart action entrypoint. | `frontend/storefront/app/product/[urlKey]/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/cart.ts` |
| Cart create/read | Implemented | Cart is created lazily and rendered as cart-only surface (items/quantities/totals) with explicit transition to checkout route. | `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/cart.ts`, `frontend/storefront/app/cart/page.tsx` |
| Header mini-cart indicator | Implemented | Header cart entry now shows live quantity badge and Magento-style hover/focus dropdown preview (items + subtotal + quick actions). | `frontend/storefront/app/layout.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/src/components/header.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/cart.ts` |
| Cart update quantity | Implemented | Cart item quantity updates are available via storefront server actions using Magento GraphQL cart-item UID mapping. | `frontend/storefront/app/cart/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/cart.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/cart.ts` |
| Cart remove item | Implemented | Cart item removal is available via storefront server actions and clears cart cookie when cart becomes empty. | `frontend/storefront/app/cart/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/cart.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/cart.ts` |
| Guest checkout placement | Partial | Dedicated `/checkout` page supports guest and signed-in placement; signed-in checkout now auto-prefills account email/default shipping address. Fallback UX for zero shipping methods remains pending. | `frontend/storefront/app/checkout/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/checkout.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/customer.ts` |
| Order confirmation | Implemented | Dedicated confirmation surface is available after successful checkout. | `frontend/storefront/app/order/confirmation/page.tsx` |

| Customer registration | Implemented | Registration route/action is available with create-account + auto-login handoff, prefilled non-sensitive retry fields, and Magento-aligned password hints/strength UX (min length + trim-aware validation). | `frontend/storefront/app/register/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/src/components/register-password-fields.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/account.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/customer.ts` |
| Customer account profile | Implemented | Dashboard + account information edit + password update + address book CRUD + newsletter preference are wired to Magento customer APIs; password forms include visibility toggles and strength/min-length guidance aligned to registration UX; address save resolves Magento-required `region_id` for strict country/state validation. | `frontend/storefront/app/account/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/account/edit/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/account/password/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/account/addresses/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/account/newsletter/page.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/app/actions/account-management.ts`, `frontend/storefront/src/components/account-password-fields.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/src/components/register-password-fields.tsx`, `frontend/storefront/src/lib/commerce/customer.ts` |

| Theme debug visibility | Implemented | Active theme and source (cookie/env) exposed via debug endpoint. | `frontend/storefront/app/api/theme/route.ts` |
